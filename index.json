Typically, untrained deep convolutional networks, which include image sampling operations, serve as effective image priors. However, they tend to overfit to noise in image restoration tasks due to being overparameterized. OES addresses this by adaptively pruning networks at random initialization to a level of underparameterization. This process effectively captures low-frequency image components even without training, by just masking. When trained to fit noisy image, these pruned subnetworks, which we term Sparse-DIP, resist overfitting to noise. This benefit arises from underparameterization and the regularization effect of masking, constraining them in the manifold of image priors. We demonstrate that subnetworks pruned through OES surpass other leading pruning methods, such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis, which is known to be suboptimal for image recovery tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the transferability of OES-masks and the characteristics of sparse-subnetworks for image generation.","tags":[],"title":"Optimal Eye Surgeon: Finding image priors through sparse generators at initialization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guangliang Liu","Milad Afshari","Xitong Zhang","Zhiyu Xue","Avrajit Ghosh","Bidhan Bashyal","Rongrong Wang","Kristen Johnson"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1717691092,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1717691092,"objectID":"1e226cdda56b8dd8529004751160c8b2","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/forget/","publishdate":"2024-06-06T12:24:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/forget/","section":"publication","summary":"While task-agnostic debiasing provides notable generalizability and reduced reliance on downstream data, its impact on language modeling ability and the risk of relearning social biases from downstream task-specific data remain as the two most significant challenges when debiasing Pretrained Language Models (PLMs). The impact on language modeling ability can be alleviated given a high-quality and long-contextualized debiasing corpus, but there remains a deficiency in understanding the specifics of relearning biases. We empirically ascertain that the effectiveness of task-agnostic debiasing hinges on the quantitative bias level of both the task-specific data used for downstream applications and the debiased model. We empirically show that the lower bound of the bias level of the downstream fine-tuned model can be approximated by the bias level of the debiased model, in most practical cases. To gain more in-depth understanding about how the parameters of PLMs change during fine-tuning due to the forgetting issue of PLMs, we propose a novel framework which can Propagate Socially-fair Debiasing to Downstream Fine-tuning, ProSocialTuning. Our proposed framework can push the fine-tuned model to approach the bias lower bound during downstream fine-tuning, indicating that the ineffectiveness of debiasing can be alleviated by overcoming the forgetting issue through regularizing successfully debiased attention heads based on the PLMs' bias levels from stages of pretraining and debiasing.","tags":[],"title":"Towards Understanding Task-agnostic Debiasing Through the Lenses of Intrinsic Bias and Forgetfulness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xitong Zhang","Ismail R Alkhouri","Rongrong Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1715012692,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1715012692,"objectID":"896616baf99ba7a83c856d5906b487c3","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/compression/","publishdate":"2024-05-06T12:24:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/compression/","section":"publication","summary":"Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in addressing many previously unsolvable tasks. However, the storage and computational requirements associated with DNNs pose a challenge for deploying these trained models on resource-limited devices. Therefore, a plethora of compression and pruning techniques have been proposed in recent years. Low-rank decomposition techniques are among the approaches most utilized to address this problem. Compared to post-training compression, compression-promoted training is still under-explored. In this paper, we present a theoretically-justified novel approach, termed Low-Rank Induced Training (LoRITa), that promotes low-rankness through the composition of linear layers and compresses by using singular value truncation. This is achieved without the need to change the structure at inference time or require constrained and/or additional optimization, other than the standard weight decay regularization. Moreover, LoRITa eliminates the need to (i) initialize with pre-trained models and (ii) specify rank selection prior to training. Our experimental results (i) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using MNIST on Fully Connected Networks, CIFAR10 on Vision Transformers, and CIFAR10/100 on Convolutional Neural Networks, and (ii) illustrate that we achieve either competitive or SOTA results when compared to leading structured pruning methods in terms of FLOPs and parameters drop.","tags":[],"title":"Structure-Preserving Network Compression Via Low-Rank Induced Training Through Linear Layers Composition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Holly R Steach","Siddharth Viswanath","Yixuan He","Xitong Zhang","Natalia Ivanova","Matthew Hirn","Michael Perlmutter","Smita Krishnaswamy"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1714407892,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714407892,"objectID":"2b59266d3913d5d61411b7bfe65fe1c9","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/infer/","publishdate":"2024-04-29T12:24:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/infer/","section":"publication","summary":"The ability to measure gene expression at single-cell resolution has elevated our understanding of how biological features emerge from complex and interdependent networks at molecular, cellular, and tissue scales. As technologies have evolved that complement scRNAseq measurements with things like single-cell proteomic, epigenomic, and genomic information, it becomes increasingly apparent how much biology exists as a product of multimodal regulation. Biological processes such as transcription, translation, and post-translational or epigenetic modification impose both energetic and specific molecular demands on a cell and are therefore implicitly constrained by the metabolic state of the cell. While metabolomics is crucial for defining a holistic model of any biological process, the chemical heterogeneity of the metabolome makes it particularly difficult to measure, and technologies capable of doing this at single-cell resolution are far behind other multiomics modalities. To address these challenges, we present GEFMAP (Gene Expression-based Flux Mapping and Metabolic Pathway Prediction), a method based on geometric deep learning for predicting flux through reactions in a global metabolic network using transcriptomics data, which we ultimately apply to scRNAseq. GEFMAP leverages the natural graph structure of metabolic networks to learn both a biological objective for each cell and estimate a mass-balanced relative flux rate for each reaction in each cell using novel deep learning models.","tags":[],"title":"Inferring Metabolic States from Single Cell Transcriptomic Data via Geometric Deep Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guangliang Liu","Zhiyu Xue","Xitong Zhang","Kristen Johnson","Rongrong Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1696695892,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696695892,"objectID":"05bf3ea4a46a178cc984480230bd3ccc","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/pactuning/","publishdate":"2023-10-07T12:24:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pactuning/","section":"publication","summary":"Fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) for downstream tasks is a large-scale optimization problem, in which the choice of the training algorithm critically determines how well the trained model can generalize to unseen test data, especially in the context of few-shot learning. To achieve good generalization performance and avoid overfitting, techniques such as data augmentation and pruning are often applied. However, adding these regularizations necessitates heavy tuning of the hyperparameters of optimization algorithms, such as the popular Adam optimizer. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fine-tuning method, PAC-tuning, to address this optimization challenge. First, based on PAC training, PAC-tuning directly minimizes the PAC-Bayes generalization bound to learn proper parameter distribution variances. Second, PAC-tuning modifies the gradient by injecting the noise variances learned in the first stage into the model parameters during training, a variation of perturbed gradient descent (PGD). However, in the few-shot setting, minimizing the PAC-Bayes generalization bound of a overparametrized model such as PLMs and injecting noise into it is a nontrivial task. Our experimental results across 5 GLUE benchmark tasks demonstrate the PAC-tuning framework successfully fulfills the challenging fine-tuning tasks and outperforms strong baseline methods by a visible margin, further confirming the potential to apply PAC training for any other settings where the Adam optimizer is currently used for training.","tags":[],"title":"PAC-tuning: Fine-tuning Pre-trained Language Models with PAC-driven Perturbed Gradient Descent","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1696449641,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696449641,"objectID":"d91f96721e3041478eeb6b9fe9acb3a5","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/talk/unlocking-tuning-free-generalization-minimizing-the-pac-bayes-bound-with-trainable-priors/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T15:59:41-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/unlocking-tuning-free-generalization-minimizing-the-pac-bayes-bound-with-trainable-priors/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Unlocking Tuning-Free Generalization: Minimizing the PAC-Bayes Bound with Trainable Priors","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xitong Zhang","Avrajit Ghosh","Guangliang Liu","Rongrong Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1696170598,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696170598,"objectID":"cffe98e6c29a767446bf4243c41171e7","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/preprint-pac-bayes/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T10:29:58-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/preprint-pac-bayes/","section":"publication","summary":"Our proposed tuning-free PAC-Bayes training framework achieves test performance comparable to that of SGD/Adam, even when the latter are optimized through a complete grid search and supplemented with additional regularization terms.","tags":[],"title":"Unlocking Tuning-free Generalization: Minimizing the PAC-Bayes Bound with Trainable Priors","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1691780452,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691780452,"objectID":"63ef6fc5cea64681c4275ffb0d7c5f28","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/talk/explicit-and-implicit-regularization-in-machine-learning/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T15:53:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/explicit-and-implicit-regularization-in-machine-learning/","section":"event","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Explicit and Implicit Regularization in Machine Learning","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xitong Zhang","Shusil Dangi","Sandesh Ghimire","Ravi Dayana"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1691690932,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1691690932,"objectID":"6db12a24ef58dff3468829d9de2c8f17","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/project/diffusion/","publishdate":"2023-08-10T14:08:52-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/diffusion/","section":"project","summary":"During the Qualcomm 2023 summer internship, we initially delved into unsupervised inpainting and outpainting using the RePaint framework.

To answer this question, first, we show that the discrete H.B momentum update (GD+M) follows a continuous trajectory induced by a modified loss, which consists of an original loss and an implicit regularizer. Then, we show that this implicit regularizer for (GD+M) is stronger than that of (GD) by factor, thus explaining why (GD+M) shows better generalization performance and higher test accuracy than (GD). Furthermore, we extend our analysis to the stochastic version of gradient descent with momentum (SGD+M) and characterize the continuous trajectory of the update of (SGD+M) in a pointwise sense.

Machine learning (ML) is well-suited for real-time CO2 monitoring because of its computational efficiency. However, most existing applications of ML yield only one prediction (i.e., the expectation) for a given input, which may not properly reflect the distribution of the testing data, if it has a shift with respect to that of the training data. The Simultaneous Quantile Regression (SQR) method can estimate the entire conditional distribution of the target variable of a neural network via pinball loss. Here, we incorporate this technique into seismic inversion for purposes of CO2 monitoring. The uncertainty map is then calculated pixel by pixel from a particular prediction interval around the median. We also propose a novel data-augmentation method by sampling the uncertainty to further improve prediction accuracy. The developed methodology is tested on synthetic Kimberlina data, which are created by the Department of Energy and based on a CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) project in California. The results prove that the proposed network can estimate the subsurface velocity rapidly and with sufficient resolution. Furthermore, the computed uncertainty quantifies the prediction accuracy. The method remains robust even if the testing data are distorted due to problems in the field data acquisition. Another test demonstrates the effectiveness of the developed data-augmentation method in increasing the spatial resolution of the estimated velocity field and in reducing the prediction error.","tags":[],"title":"Enhanced prediction accuracy with uncertainty quantification in monitoring CO2 sequestration using convolutional neural networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chengyuan Deng","Shihang Feng","Hanchen Wang","Xitong Zhang","Peng Jin","Yinan Feng","Qili Zeng","Yinpeng Chen","Youzuo Lin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1670346451,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670346451,"objectID":"618d3814bc581e6ac31cc93ddcdc1aaf","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/openfwi/","publishdate":"2022-12-06T13:07:31-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/openfwi/","section":"publication","summary":"OpenFWI dataset","tags":[],"title":"OpenFWI: Large-scale Multi-structural Benchmark Datasets for Full Waveform Inversion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chengyuan Deng","Shihang Feng","Hanchen Wang","Xitong Zhang","Peng Jin","Yinan Feng","Qili Zeng","Yinpeng Chen","Youzuo Lin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1670284800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670284800,"objectID":"e8f8d235e8e7f2efd912bfe865363fc3","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/project/example/","publishdate":"2022-12-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/example/","section":"project","summary":"OpenFWI is a collection of large-scale, multi-structural benchmark datasets for machine learning driven seismic FWI.

The promise of data-driven techniques relies on the availability of a large volume of high-quality training datasets. Due to the high cost of obtaining data through expensive physical experiments, instruments, and simulations, data augmentation techniques for scientific applications have emerged as a new direction for obtaining scientific data recently. However, existing data augmentation techniques originating from computer vision yield physically unacceptable data samples that are not helpful for the domain problems that we are interested in. In this article, we develop new data augmentation techniques based on convolutional neural networks. Specifically, our generative models leverage different physics knowledge (such as governing equations, observable perception, and physics phenomena) to improve the quality of the synthetic data. To validate the effectiveness of our data augmentation techniques, we apply them to solve a subsurface seismic full-waveform inversion using simulated CO2 leakage data. Our interest is to invert for subsurface velocity models associated with very small CO2 leakage. We validate the performance of our methods using comprehensive numerical tests. Via comparison and analysis, we show that data-driven seismic imaging can be significantly enhanced by using our data augmentation techniques. Particularly, the imaging quality has been improved by 15% in test scenarios of general-sized leakage and 17% in small-sized leakage when using an augmented training set obtained with our techniques.","tags":[],"title":"Making Invisible Visible: Data-Driven Seismic Inversion With Spatio-Temporally Constrained Data Augmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xitong Zhang","Yixuan He","Nathan Brugnone","Michael Perlmutter","Matthew Hirn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638804661,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638804661,"objectID":"3e254040e3a7c1d9b7d9c86219c2769e","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/magnet/","publishdate":"2021-12-06T11:31:01-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/magnet/","section":"publication","summary":"We proposed a directed graph neural network based on a complex Hermitian matrix known as the Magnetic Laplacian.","tags":[],"title":"Magnet: A neural network for directed graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junbong Jang","Chuangqi Wang","Xitong Zhang","Hee June Choi","Xiang Pan","Bolun Lin","Yudong Yu","Carly Whittle","Madison Ryan","Yenyu Chen","Kwonmoo Lee"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1637601915,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637601915,"objectID":"05d400ad6ba103ece195522acde21fe2","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/publication/cellreport/","publishdate":"2021-11-22T13:25:15-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cellreport/","section":"publication","summary":"To accurately segment cell edges and quantify cellular morphodynamics from live-cell imaging data, we developed a deep learning-based pipeline termed MARS-Net (multiple-microscopy-type-based accurate and robust segmentation network).

For effective training on distinct types of live-cell microscopy, MARS-Net comprises a pretrained VGG19 encoder with U-Net decoder and dropout layers.

Ideally, realtime monitoring and near-future forecasting would provide site operators with great insights to understand the dynamics of the subsurface reservoir and assess any potential risks. However, due to obstacles such as high deployment cost, availability of acquisition equipment, exclusion zones around surface structures, only very sparse seismic imaging data can be obtained during monitoring. That leads to an unavoidable and growing knowledge gap over time. The operator needs to understand the fluid flow throughout the project lifetime and the seismic data are only available at a limited number of times. This is insufficient for understanding reservoir behavior. To overcome those challenges, we have developed spatio-temporal neuralnetwork-based models that can produce high-fidelity interpolated or extrapolated images effectively and efficiently. Specifically, our models are built on an autoencoder, and incorporate the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure with a new loss function regularized by optical flow. We validate the performance of our models using real 4-D post-stack seismic imaging data acquired at the Sleipner CO2 sequestration field. We employ two different strategies in evaluating our models. Numerically, we compare our models with different baseline approaches using classic pixelbased metrics. We also conduct a blind survey and collect a total of 20 responses from domain experts to evaluate the quality of data generated by our models. Via both numerical and expert evaluation, we conclude that our models can produce high-quality 2-D/3-D seismic imaging data at a reasonable cost, offering the possibility of real-time monitoring or even near-future forecasting of the CO2 storage reservoir.","tags":[],"title":"Connect the Dots: In Situ 4-D Seismic Monitoring of CO2 Storage With Spatio-Temporal CNNs","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1633032022,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633032022,"objectID":"b7208e8a176d6e4d08b2df16a879c440","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/talk/data-driven-seismic-inversion-learning-to-solve-inverse-problems-via-physics-informed-networks/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T15:18:22-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/data-driven-seismic-inversion-learning-to-solve-inverse-problems-via-physics-informed-networks/","section":"event","summary":"Center for Nonlinear Studies Seminar.","tags":[],"title":"Data-Driven Seismic Inversion: Learning to Solve Inverse Problems via Physics-Informed Networks","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608062400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608062400,"objectID":"08487a8f7fc7ebd3463ecc84ebcd4bf7","permalink":"https://ZhangXit.github.io/talk/earthquake-source-characterization-with-graphical-deep-learning/","publishdate":"2023-10-10T15:35:40-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/earthquake-source-characterization-with-graphical-deep-learning/","section":"event","summary":"AGU 2020 Fall Meeting Oral Presentation.","tags":[],"title":"Earthquake Source Characterization with Graphical Deep Learning","type":"event"},{"authors":["Xitong Zhang","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

The availability of vehicle trajectories has provided a promising data source for traffic estimation, as it shed light on traffic status and characterizes human transition activates that are otherwise extremely hard to track. However, there are major challenges in incorporating trajectories in traffic estimation largely because of its inherent uncertainty from data sparsity and semantic ambiguity. Entangled in complicated road topology and spatiotemporal traffic dynamics, properly embedding trajectories in modeling is especially difficult. To address the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a Boosted Trajectory Calibration (BTRAC) framework to model traffic states of complex road networks that effectively integrates trajectory information. In the framework, we first use a deep neural network to predict the traffic states of each road individually from historical traffic information, along with the prediction uncertainty. Then we refine the predictions by an iterative boosting calibration procedure with embedded trajectories. We conduct extensive large-scale empirical studies on two cities and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","tags":[],"title":"Boosted trajectory calibration for traffic state estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
